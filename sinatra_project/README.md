# Muppet Show Creator


This is a little app I made using Sinatra where I wanted to simulate a user being able to create the cast for their very own Muppet show! 
Has the ability to sign up a user, login, and use CRUD on their Muppets!

### Prerequisites

This app was built using Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord.

### Installing 
Copy the github SSH.

In your terminal:

    git clone "pasted-repo-key"
    cd "pasted-repo-key"

Run:

    "bundle install"

For the necessary Gems to run the project.
Next, type

    "shotgun"

In the terminal so that the server gets started. Then head over to the port on your local host (this is usually typing localhost:9393 in your web browser)

After that, you're ready to use the website!
